# Due-time 

This project is developed as a part of the Zip Recruiter Hackathon held at Los Angeles.
Due time app is intended to eliminate the back and forth of emails between candidates and recruiters.
Candidates and recruiters add their availability in the app and overlapping/matching timeslots are matched and a meeting between the candidate and recruiter is fixed.
An email is sent to both the candidate and the recruiter about the match and a google calendar event is added to their corresponding calendars.
